# Medicine_Recommendation_System
Project Overview: Development of a Medicine Recommendation System using machine learning to classify medicines based on symptoms related to various diseases (e.g., fever, allergies).
Technology Stack: Built as a web application using the Flask framework.
Functionality:
Users input symptoms to receive disease predictions.
Utilizes multiple machine learning algorithms:
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forests
Gradient Boosting
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Multinomial Naive Bayes
Data Sources: Integrates comprehensive data from pre-loaded databases, providing:
Illness descriptions
Precautions
Prescription schedules
Suggested diets
Exercise regimens
User Experience: Features a user-friendly interface for easy symptom entry and quick, accurate advice.
Impact: Aims to enhance decision-making for healthcare professionals and improve accessibility to healthcare services, serving as a valuable resource for initial health-related inquiries.
Keywords: Medicine Recommendation System, Disease prediction, Machine Learning algorithms, Healthcare resources, Informed decision-making.
